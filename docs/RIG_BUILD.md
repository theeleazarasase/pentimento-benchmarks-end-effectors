# Rig Build v1 (Pull-to-slip hook rig)

## Attachment chain (repeatability)
M6 eye bolt -> quick link/carabiner -> ball-bearing swivel -> braided line

## Key build notes
- Align pull direction with the load cell beam axis (minimize torsion).
- Add an overload stop under the free end (protect the load cell).
- Strain-relief the load cell cable.

## Recommended base
- Rigid base plate (wood/aluminum) OR a thick, high-infill printed base.
- Goal: the structure should not flex; only the load cell should deflect.
